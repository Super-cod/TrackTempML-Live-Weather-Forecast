# TrackTempML-Live-Weather-Forecast
LiveWeatherML is a real-time weather tracking and prediction system using temperature and humidity sensors connected to an Arduino. The sensor data is fed into a machine learning model built with scikit-learn to predict conditions like precipitation, wind speed, and visibility, providing accurate, real-time weather forecasting based on live data.
